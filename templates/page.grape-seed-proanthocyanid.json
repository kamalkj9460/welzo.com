A class of phytonutrients (plant chemicals) known as flavonoids function as antioxidants. Red grape seeds and skin contain GSPs, which are responsible for the astringent flavor of wine. Another type of flavonoid found in grape skins is resveratrol. Although it has attracted a lot of attention for its potential health advantages, GSPs may be even more advantageous than resveratrol. GSPs are potent antioxidants that are capable of scavenging dangerous free radicals.

Beneficial to Skin Health<br\/><br\/>Proanthocyanidins found in grape seeds can also help to improve the condition of your skin. These nutrients' antioxidant properties remove potentially harmful free radicals from the body, which would otherwise harm cells and cause inflammation of the skin. These substances can also encourage the production of new collagen and shield the existing collagen from deterioration. This could increase the elasticity of your skin and lessen the appearance of wrinkles. Psoriasis and eczema are two skin conditions for which grape seed extract is occasionally used as a natural treatment.<br\/><br\/>6. Could Improve Brain Health<br\/><br\/>Better brain health has also been connected to grape seed extract. According to a small study, those who consumed grape seed supplements for 12 weeks had better attention and memory than those who did not. <\/p><p>7. May Aid in Diabetes Management<br\/><br\/>By enhancing blood sugar control, grape seed extract may also assist in managing diabetes. In one small study, type 2 diabetics who took a supplement containing grape seed for eight weeks had lower fasting blood sugar levels than those who did not take the supplement. According to a different study, type 2 diabetics who took a grape seed supplement had less insulin resistance.<br\/><br\/>8. Cardiovascular Advantages<br\/><br\/>Antioxidants found in grape seeds, such as proanthocyanidins, may have heart-healthy properties. These substances have been demonstrated to improve blood vessel health and lower blood pressure. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that in people with high cholesterol, grape seed extract increases HDL (good cholesterol) and lowers LDL (bad cholesterol).<br\/><\/p><p>9. May Aid in Weight Management<br\/><br\/>Grape seed extract may also aid in weight management, though more research is necessary. In a small study, participants who consumed a grape seed supplement along with a calorie-restricted diet shed more pounds and body fat than those who did not.<br\/><br\/>10. Potential Adverse Reactions and Safety Measures<br\/><br\/>In general, grape seed extract is well tolerated. However, it may result in some negative side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Furthermore, grape seed extract may interact with drugs that thin the blood, like warfarin (Coumadin). Before taking grape seed extract, discuss your medication regimen with your doctor.<br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--15389620011101__5cbe206a-8974-430b-ab53-0d3a9890d088-1673004137a8fb07c4-0","template--15389620011101__5cbe206a-8974-430b-ab53-0d3a9890d088-1673004137a8fb07c4-1"],"settings":{"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15389620011101__c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea-1673004153f6a3b721-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Pharmacokinetics"}},"template--15389620011101__c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea-1673004153f6a3b721-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>The constituents of grape seed extract include proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, and catechins.
