Its primary function is to speed up the recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's primary source of energy, by adding a phosphate group to ADP and creating ATP. When there is a high demand for energy, such as during muscle contraction, this process takes place in the mitochondria.About 95% of the creatine pool in skeletal muscles is present as phosphocreatine (PCr). In a reaction mediated by creatine kinase (CK), PCr quickly reforms back into PCr after donating its phosphate group to ADP to create ATP. The free creatine (Cr) form is where the remaining creatine pool is located. The SLC6A8 transporter is responsible for mediating creatine uptake into muscle cells."}},"3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Overview","button_link":""}},"c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Uses","button_link":""}},"e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Side Effects","button_link":""}},"02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Medication","button_link":""}},"6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Ingredients","button_link":""}},"7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Supplements","button_link":""}},"9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Pharmacokinetics","button_link":""}},"template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Creatine.png"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-0","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-1","3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254","c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458","e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87","02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde","6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318","7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f","9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3"],"settings":{"body_text":"#12022f","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":150}},"d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"What is Creatine?"}},"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Creatine levels in muscles are typically 0.3 mmol\/kg in healthy people, but they can rise to 16â€“20 mmol\/kg with dietary supplementation.<br\/><br\/>On muscle tissue, creatine has a number of anabolic effects, including:<br\/><br\/>- Enhanced synthesis of proteins<br\/><br\/>- Inducing the release of growth hormone<br\/><br\/>- Improved post-exercise recovery<br\/><br\/>- Increased strength and muscle mass<br\/><br\/>The following are possible negative effects of creatine supplementation:<br\/><br\/>- Digestive discomfort (cramps, diarrhea, etc.)<br\/><br\/>- Muscular pain<br\/><br\/>Gaining weight<br\/><br\/>- Kidney damage (when used for a long time at high doses)<br\/><br\/>- The suppression of testosterone (when used for a long time at high doses).<br\/><\/p><p>Creatine monohydrate is the most widely used type of creatine supplement and is simple to consume.
