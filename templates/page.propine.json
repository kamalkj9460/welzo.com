It smells sweet and ammonia-like and is a clear, colorless liquid. Propine is a reagent and a solvent used in the synthesis of organic compounds.Propionic acid is reduced to produce phenylpropine. Sodium hypochlorite is typically used as the reducing agent in this process in the industrial setting. Chlorine gas is created during this reaction, which needs to be handled carefully.
