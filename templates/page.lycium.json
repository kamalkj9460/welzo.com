About 90 native species to tropical and temperate regions of Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas are found there. The most well-known variety is Lycium barbarum, which is indigenous to southern China and has spread to other parts of the world. Common names for this berry include Chinese wolfberry, boxthorn goji, Tibetan goji, red wolfberry, desert wolfberry, and goji berry.Most Lycium species are small trees or shrubs, though some are also annual herbs. They have simple leaves that are arranged in whorls of three to five or in opposing pairs. Small, white flowers with five petals and five stamens are produced in panicles or axillary clusters (cymes).
