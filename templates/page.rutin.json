It is also referred to as sophorin, quercetrin, and rutoside. Due to its potential health benefits, rutin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine.When consumed orally, rutin is poorly absorbed by the body. As a result, it is frequently combined with other ingredients, like vitamin C, to boost absorption.

Could Promote Weight Loss<br\/><br\/>In studies on animals, rutin has been shown to decrease body weight and fat mass. Rutin supplementation caused a significant decrease in body weight, fat mass, and waist circumference in rats, according to one study.<br\/><br\/>Another study found that rats given rutin for eight weeks had lower levels of the hormones leptin and resistin, which are linked to obesity. It is believed that these hormones contribute to the emergence of obesity.<br\/><\/p><p><br\/>Rutin may also help prevent weight gain by decreasing the absorption of dietary fat. In a rat study, it was discovered that adding rutin to the diet could reduce fat absorption from a high-fat diet by up to 28%.<br\/><\/p><p>2. Might Decrease Inflammation<br\/><br\/>Rutin has strong anti-inflammatory properties that can help the body lessen inflammation.<br\/><br\/>Rutin was demonstrated in a test-tube study to be equally as effective at reducing inflammation as the medication phenylbutazone.<br\/><br\/>Rutin may also aid in the treatment of inflammatory diseases like osteoarthritis. Rutin supplementation significantly decreased osteoarthritis symptoms, such as joint pain and inflammation, according to a rat study.<br\/><\/p><p>3. Could Reduce Blood Pressure<br\/><br\/>A significant risk factor for heart disease is high blood pressure. By relaxing blood vessels and enhancing circulation, rutin may aid in lowering blood pressure.<br\/><br\/>One study on humans found that taking rutin supplements for eight weeks significantly lowered systolic blood pressure, which is the highest number in a blood pressure reading.<br\/><\/p><p><\/p><p>4. Could Improve Heart Health<br\/><br\/>Rutin may support heart health and lower the risk of developing heart disease.<br\/><br\/>In one animal experiment, rats with atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) received rutin supplementation, which reduced plaque buildup in the arteries and enhanced heart function.<br\/><br\/>Another rat study revealed that rutin protected against oxidative stress and helped lower cholesterol levels, both of which are risk factors for heart disease.<br\/><\/p><p>5. May Enhance Cognitive Function<br\/><br\/>Rutin may also enhance mental performance. Rutin was able to cross the blood-brain barrier, protecting brain cells from harm, according to one test-tube study.<br\/><br\/>Rutin may also be used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Rutin was found to protect brain cells from the harmful effects of beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, in a test-tube study.<br\/><\/p><p>6. May Aid in Diabetes Treatment<br\/><br\/>Diabetes may also be treated with rutin. Rutin supplementation improved insulin sensitivity and decreased fasting blood sugar levels in diabetic rats, according to one animal study.<br\/><br\/>Rutin helped people with type 2 diabetes better control their blood sugar levels, according to a different study.<br\/><\/p><p>7. Might Have Cancer-Preventive Effects<br\/><br\/>There may be anticancer properties to rutin. Rutin was able to kill colon cancer cells in a test-tube study while sparing healthy cells.<br\/><br\/>Rutin was found to inhibit the growth of stomach, lung, and breast cancer cells in another test-tube study.<br\/><br\/>8. Additional Advantages<br\/><br\/>Other possible health advantages of rutin have also been demonstrated, such as:<br\/><br\/>Rutin may assist in protecting the eyes from harm and lowering the risk of cataracts.<br\/><br\/>- Hemorrhoids: By reducing inflammation, rutin supplements may be used to treat hemorrhoids.<br\/><br\/>- Enhancing wound healing: Rutin's ability to boost blood flow and lower inflammation may help wounds heal more quickly.<br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0","template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1"],"settings":{"padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":100}},"c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15389620011101__c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea-1673004153f6a3b721-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Side Effects and Precautions"}},"template--15389620011101__c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea-1673004153f6a3b721-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Rutin is typically regarded as safe and has few known adverse effects.
