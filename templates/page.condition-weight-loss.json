Semaglutide is a synthetic analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that naturally occurs in the body and plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and influencing appetite. When injected, semaglutide binds to GLP-1 receptors, enhancing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner, thereby aiding in the control of blood sugar levels. Simultaneously, it interacts with the appetite centers in the brain, diminishing hunger and enhancing feelings of fullness and satiety. This dual action not only aids in managing blood glucose levels but also reduces overall energy intake by modulating eating behaviors, leading to weight loss. Thus, through physiological and behavioural effects, weight loss injections such as <a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/products\/wegovy\" title=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/products\/wegovy\">Wegovy<\/a> work to aid individuals in reducing their body weight and managing metabolic health.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--15523335536733__564749ab-cde4-4d87-9bb8-f8a03f205135-heading-1","template--15523335536733__564749ab-cde4-4d87-9bb8-f8a03f205135-text-1"],"settings":{"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"16553883264143cbd4":{"type":"latest-articles-slider","settings":{"title":"Latest articles","link_all":"","count_latest_articles":6,"tags":"weight loss;loss;fit;healthy;obesity;fat;cholesterol","blog-menu":"blogs","padding_top":70,"padding_bottom":70}},"1654883326cbc635d6":{"type":"faq","blocks":{"1654883326a8696fa9-0":{"type":"column","settings":{"title":"How do weight loss pills work?","text":"<p>Weight loss pills block the absorption of fat into your body.
