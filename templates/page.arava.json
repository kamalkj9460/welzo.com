It also goes by the name leflunomide. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme, is produced less when arava is taken. Arava can help to lessen arthritis-related inflammation by preventing the production of this enzyme, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Usually, one dose of arava is taken every day, with or without food. It's crucial to take Arava exactly as your doctor has advised. Without first consulting your doctor, never miss a dose or stop taking this medication. Arava side effects could include nausea, constipation, headaches, and vertigo.
