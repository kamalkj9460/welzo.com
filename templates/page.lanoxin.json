Digoxin is released into breast milk after crossing the placenta.

Digoxin excretion is reduced in congestive heart failure patients.<br\/><br\/>Digoxin Indications and Use<br\/>Digoxin is prescribed for the management of associated ventricular arrhythmias and the treatment of mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). Digoxin has a positive inotropic effect on myocardial contractility in CHF without increasing myocardial oxygen demand. The enhanced sodium-potassium ATPase activity in cardiac muscle cell membranes and the increased calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum are primarily responsible for the favorable inotropic effect. The end result is a decrease in ventricular filling pressures and an increase in cardiac output.<br\/><br\/>Digoxin has been used alone or in combination with other medications to treat CHF, and it has been linked to improvements in symptoms, weight loss, and exercise tolerance. However, data from large clinical trials have not been able to show a benefit in terms of mortality.<br\/><\/p><p>Digoxin is also recommended for the treatment of flutter and atrial fibrillation. Digoxin reduces automaticity and conduction velocity while having little impact on refractoriness in both arrhythmias. As a result, both the heart rate and the risk of thromboembolic complications in atrial fibrillation decrease.<br\/><br\/>Contraindications<br\/><br\/>Digoxin is not recommended for use in people with known drug hypersensitivity, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia.
