Plants contain pigments called carotenoids. Watermelons, pink grapefruits, apricots, and tomatoes all contain lycopene.Lycopene functions as an antioxidant by scavenging dangerous oxygen-containing molecules (also referred to as free radicals) that harm cells and result in inflammation. It is thought that free radicals play a role in the emergence of cancer and other chronic diseases.Interestingly, raw tomatoes may not be the best way to get lycopene. This is because tomatoes' cell walls are broken down during cooking, making it simpler for your body to absorb lycopene.Lycopene has been associated with a number of health advantages, such as a decreased risk of cancer and heart disease."}},"3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Overview","button_link":""}},"c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Uses","button_link":""}},"e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Side Effects","button_link":""}},"02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Medication","button_link":""}},"6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Ingredients","button_link":""}},"7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Supplements","button_link":""}},"9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Pharmacokinetics","button_link":""}},"template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Lycopene.png"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-0","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-1","3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254","c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458","e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87","02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde","6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318","7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f","9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3"],"settings":{"body_text":"#12022f","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":150}},"d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Lycopene Health Advantages"}},"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Might Lower Heart Disease Risk<br\/><br\/>A lower risk of heart disease is linked to lycopene.<br\/><br\/>Over the course of an 11-year period, one large study that examined the diets of over 1,000 adults discovered that those who consumed the most lycopene-rich foods had a significantly lower risk of dying from heart disease.<br\/><br\/>A different study looked at how lycopene supplements affected heart disease risk factors.
