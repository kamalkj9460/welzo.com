Itâ€™s often used as a food thickener or gelling agent, but it can also be taken as a supplement to promote weight loss and lower blood sugar levels.Some research suggests that glucomannan may help with weight loss by absorbing water and creating a feeling of fullness in the stomach. It may also slow down the absorption of sugar and reduce fat storage. Additionally, glucomannan has been demonstrated to lower blood sugar levels by promoting insulin sensitivity and delaying the absorption of carbohydrates. People with type 2 diabetes may benefit the most from this effect.Speak with your doctor first to determine whether glucomannan supplements are appropriate for you if you're thinking about taking them for weight loss or any other reason. Users of Welzo can use this article for informational purposes to better understand glucomannan."}},"3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Overview","button_link":""}},"c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Uses","button_link":""}},"e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Side Effects","button_link":""}},"02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Medication","button_link":""}},"6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Ingredients","button_link":""}},"7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Supplements","button_link":""}},"9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Pharmacokinetics","button_link":""}},"template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/713Hh_A7xDL._AC_SL1500.jpg"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-0","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-1","3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254","c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458","e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87","02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde","6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318","7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f","9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3"],"settings":{"body_text":"#12022f","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":150}},"d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Side Effects"}},"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>In general, glucomannan is regarded as secure.
