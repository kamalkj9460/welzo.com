It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and it works by influencing the brain's chemicals related to mood. Oral tablets, oral solutions, and injectable versions of Triavil are all readily available. While the oral solution is administered once daily, the oral tablet is taken two or three times daily. Every two weeks, an intramuscular injection of the injectable form is administered. Triavil frequently causes drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, and constipation as side effects. Additionally, Triavil may result in QT prolongation, a rare but potentially fatal condition. As a result, it's crucial to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of taking Triavil with your doctor.
