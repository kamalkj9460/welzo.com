They are a type of soluble fiber that most people with digestive problems can tolerate. Numerous health advantages, such as improved gut health, decreased constipation, and lowered cholesterol levels, may be brought on by fructo-oligosaccharides.Short chains of fructose molecules make up fructo-oligosaccharides. These molecules can function as prebiotics because the human digestive system cannot easily break them down. A prebiotic is a substance that helps the gut's beneficial bacteria grow.It has been demonstrated that fructo-oligosaccharides promote the growth of good bacteria like bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
