Although other studies have not discovered such a link, some studies have suggested that drinking water with high levels of aluminum or taking antacids that contain aluminum may be related to Alzheimer's disease. There is no proof yet that using aluminum cookware makes people more susceptible to Alzheimer's.If aluminum contributes to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, further investigation is required. If you are worried about your exposure to aluminum, you can reduce it by avoiding products that contain it and switching to filtered water for drinking and cooking.Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative condition that progresses over time.
