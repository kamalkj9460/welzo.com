A glycoprotein called lactoferrin, which has an average molecular weight of about 80 kDa, is found in large quantities in many secretory fluids, including milk, saliva, tears, and mucus. Lactoferrin has antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties in addition to its ability to bind iron. Lactoferrin has been suggested as a potential treatment for a number of human diseases, including infections, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and diabetes due to its wide range of functions.
