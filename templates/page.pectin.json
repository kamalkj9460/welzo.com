Foods can be thickened or gelled using this soluble fiber. Citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin, but it can also be found in other fruits and vegetables like apples, pears, peas, carrots, and potatoes.There are numerous uses for pectin in both food and non-food contexts. Pectin is frequently used in cooking as a thickener or gelling agent in jams, jellies, and other fruit preserves. Additionally, it can be used to create batters and doughs without gluten. Pectin has uses outside of the kitchen as well. It is sometimes used as a laxative and as a skin conditioner in the cosmetics industry.
