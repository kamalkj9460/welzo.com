The melting point of the free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, is the sixth-highest of all elements. The majority of the element's global production (roughly 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys, because it readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys.Despite having a surface that quickly oxidizes in air from silvery to dark gray, molybdenum has a much higher corrosion resistance than chromium. Compounds of molybdenum are used as electrolytic materials, lubricants, and catalysts. For some bacteria, molybdenum is a crucial trace nutrient.
