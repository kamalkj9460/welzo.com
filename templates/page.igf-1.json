In response to stimulation by growth hormone (GH), the liver is the main organ that produces IGF-1. The anterior pituitary gland secretes GH, which controls cell division and linear growth. IGF-1 is an anabolic hormone that encourages tissue regeneration and growth. It also has a significant impact on body composition, glucose homeostasis, and metabolism.IGF-1 binds to its receptor (IGF1R) on the surface of cells, which activates a number of signaling pathways that support cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. IGF-1R belongs to the family of tyrosine kinase receptors and can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins. This article is meant to provide users of Welzo with information about IGF-1."}},"3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Overview","button_link":""}},"c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Uses","button_link":""}},"e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Side Effects","button_link":""}},"02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Medication","button_link":""}},"6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Ingredients","button_link":""}},"7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Supplements","button_link":""}},"9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Pharmacokinetics","button_link":""}},"template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-52-1024x1004.png"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-0","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-1","3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254","c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458","e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87","02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde","6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318","7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f","9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3"],"settings":{"body_text":"#12022f","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":150}},"d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Benefits"}},"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>aids in preserving muscle mass<br\/>IGF-1 contributes to the development and repair of muscle.
