It usually affects joints, such as the shoulder, elbow or hip, but can appear anywhere in the body. Bursitis happens for various reasons but can most often be attributed to repetitive movements, intense pressure from leaning on a joint for long periods of time, or infections. Symptoms of this condition include pain at the affected area, swelling and tenderness when touching the inflamed area. Treatment for bursitis usually involves resting the affected joint and keeping it in an elevated position when possible. Oral anti-inflammatory medications are sometimes prescribed to reduce pain and other severe cases may require injections into the site of inflammation.
