Through the action of two cytochrome P450 enzymes, it is made from cholesterol. Pregnenolone serves as a natural neurosteroid and is also the starting material for the synthesis of all other endogenous steroids. The brain is one tissue where this naturally occurring progestogen and adrenal steroid is produced. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission and controlling glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are its two main functions.
