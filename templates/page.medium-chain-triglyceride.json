Look no further than Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs)! MCTs are fatty acids found naturally in some foods such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and milk. They have a variety of benefits, including providing longer-lasting energy, supporting the digestive system, helping with weight loss goals, and boosting brain power.MCTs have numerous advantages over other sources of energy. Unlike glucose or other carbohydrates that can cause sudden spikes and dips in blood sugar levels resulting in crashing energy levels, MCTs provide sustained energy instead. This means less time struggling with tiredness or fatigue throughout the day and more time to conquer any task thrown your way! In addition, MCTs can help increase metabolism which can lead to achieving a healthy weight â€“ perfect for those of us looking for the perfect balance between staying energized and feeling our best."}},"3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Overview","button_link":""}},"c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Uses","button_link":""}},"e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Side Effects","button_link":""}},"02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Medication","button_link":""}},"6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Ingredients","button_link":""}},"7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Supplements","button_link":""}},"9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Pharmacokinetics","button_link":""}},"template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/H7c3c515457604ee38e6a1ccaed59b42fS.jpg_960x960_3cb8b0e7-da02-4497-a51a-2fc255df4c0b.webp"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-0","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-1","3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254","c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458","e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87","02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde","6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318","7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f","9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3"],"settings":{"body_text":"#12022f","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":150}},"d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"What are Medium-Chain Triglycerides?"}},"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Saturated fats called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are processed differently from other types of fat.
