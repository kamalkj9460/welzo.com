Readers of Welzo should read this article to learn more about Peripheral neuropathyA condition known as heart valve disease (HVD) occurs when one or more of the heart's valves aren't functioning properly.The tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve, and aortic valve are the four valves in the heart. With each heartbeat, heart valves open and close, ensuring that blood flows through the heart in the proper direction.It can be problematic if a heart valve isn't functioning properly. Blood flow can be hampered by heart valve disease, adding to the strain on your heart. Heart failure can occur occasionally as a result of heart valve disease.HVD comes in two main varieties:- valvular stenosis, which occurs when the valve doesn't fully open- regurgitation or valvular insufficiency, which occurs when the valve does not close tightly.
