Some of the key advantages of Wegovy include:<\/p><ol><li>Effective weight loss: Clinical trials have demonstrated significant weight loss in patients treated with Wegovy. The medication can help individuals achieve considerable and sustained weight loss when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.<\/li><li>Improvement in obesity-related health conditions: Wegovy has been shown to improve various weight-related health markers, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control. These improvements can help reduce the risk of health complications associated with obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.<\/li><li>Convenient administration: Wegovy is administered as a once-weekly injection, which may be more convenient for some patients compared to daily oral medications or other weight loss injections. This convenience factor can lead to improved patient compliance, increasing the likelihood of successful weight loss and long-term health benefits.<\/li><li>Gradual titration of dosage: Wegovy is available in different strengths, allowing healthcare professionals to adjust the dosage based on a patient's response to the medication and their tolerance to any potential side effects. This personalised approach can help optimise the treatment plan for each individual.<\/li><li>Comprehensive weight management: Wegovy can be used as part of a holistic weight management plan that includes a balanced, reduced-calorie diet and regular physical activity. By combining pharmacological intervention with sustainable lifestyle changes, individuals can maximise the benefits of Wegovy treatment and work towards achieving long-term weight loss success.<\/li><\/ol><p>In summary, the advantages of Wegovy lie in its effectiveness, convenience, and potential to improve overall health and quality of life for individuals struggling with obesity and weight-related health conditions.<\/p><h3>What causes Obesity?<\/h3><p>Obesity is considered to be a complex issue with many potential causes. Obesity and increased body<br\/>weight are likely to happen when surplus calories are consumed, particularly from foods high in fats and sugars.<\/p><p><br\/>The prevalence of obesity these days is due to change in our lifestyle which makes it harder for people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity. Genetics also play an important role, as it determines how the energy from the food you consume is utilised and stored in your body. There are some underlying health conditions such as hypothyroidism that may contribute to weight-gain. However, if treated effectively with medicines then they do not contribute much to weight related problems.<\/p><p><br\/>Also, some medications such as steroids, medicines to treat high-blood pressure and mental health<br\/>conditions may contribute to weight-gain.<\/p><p>The best way to treat obesity is to create a caloric deficit, to eat a well-balanced diet and to exercise<br\/>regularly. Taking up physical activities such as fast-paced walking, jogging or swimming for 2.5 to 5 hours per week would be considered a decent amount of physical activity. You may also benefit from receiving support and counseling from a trained healthcare professional to gain a better insight into your<br\/>relationship with food and develop healthier eating habits.<br\/>And if lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help to lose weight there are medicinal treatments available to assist with weight loss.<br\/><\/p><h3>Semaglutide (Wegovy) for Weight Loss<\/h3><p>There are several treatments available as adjuncts to a calorie-controlled diet and increased physical activity for weight-loss. Here, we will discuss a novel GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide) analogue,<br\/>Semaglutide. Semaglutide works by acting like a hormone in the body that alerts brain receptors involved<br\/>in food intake and appetite regulation. It is known to reduce food cravings, regulates appetite and slows gastric emptying, which means it keeps you fuller for longer. As a result of these it makes you consume less calories, resulting in weight-loss.<br\/><\/p><p>Wegovy is a licensed in the UK for the treatment of obesity in adults. It is used in addition to diet and<br\/>exercise for long-term weight management. It is licensed for adults who are either obese (BMI ≥30kg\/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg\/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity such as high-blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol.<\/p><p><br\/>Wegovy is usually taken as a weekly injection (under the skin), and it comes in 5 different strengths. The<br\/>user begins the treatment with 0.25mg per week which is to be used for the first 4 weeks and then increase it to 0.5mg, then 1mg, to 1.7mg, eventually reaching the maintenance dose of 2.4mg per weekly. To reach the maintenance dose, it will take a minimum of 17 weeks as increase in strength is done monthly and in a<br\/>clinically suitable and approved manner. Also, the clinicians take individual circumstances in account before recommending a higher dose as it may not be suitable for everyone to increase the dose as per the guidelines.<\/p><h3>When do you see the benefits after using Wegovy<\/h3><p><br\/>Weight loss may begin within the first 4 weeks of treatment with Wegovy, but the full effects of treatment may not be seen for several months or longer.<br\/>➔ In studies, weight loss in adults was assessed over a 68-week period.<br\/>➔ Patients using wegovy lost an average of 35 lbs (15.9 kg), or about 15% of their body weight<br\/>compared to 6 lbs (2.7 kg), or roughly 2.5% body weight in the placebo group.<br\/>➔ Overall, after 68 weeks, 83% of adults taking Wegovy lost 5% or more of their weight compared to<br\/>31% of adults taking a placebo.<\/p><h4>What are the disadvantages of Wegovy?<\/h4><p>While Wegovy offers several advantages as a weight loss medication, it also has some disadvantages that should be considered. Some of the key disadvantages of Wegovy include:<\/p><ol><li>Side effects: Wegovy can cause side effects in some patients, including gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation. Although these side effects are usually mild and tend to subside over time, they can be bothersome for some individuals and may lead to discontinuation of the medication.<\/li><li>Injection administration: Wegovy is administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection, which may be inconvenient or uncomfortable for some patients, especially those who are averse to needles or self-injections.<\/li><li>Cost: Wegovy can be relatively expensive compared to other weight loss medications, which may make it less accessible for some individuals, particularly those without insurance coverage or in regions where the medication is not subsidised by the healthcare system.<\/li><li>Limited availability: Wegovy may not be available in all countries or regions, and its accessibility may be limited depending on local regulations and licensing requirements.<\/li><li>Not a standalone solution: Wegovy should not be considered a standalone solution for weight loss. It must be used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity as part of a comprehensive weight management plan. This may require significant commitment and lifestyle changes on the part of the patient.<\/li><li>Contraindications and precautions: Wegovy may not be suitable for all individuals, particularly those with specific medical conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those taking certain medications. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine if Wegovy is an appropriate treatment option based on individual circumstances.<\/li><\/ol>"}}},"block_order":["template--15463830913117__7e56dd23-5ca7-4e5c-90e3-bf6578ddfa96-16820267805dd139ea-0","template--15463830913117__7e56dd23-5ca7-4e5c-90e3-bf6578ddfa96-16820267805dd139ea-1"],"settings":{"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"1699015773272801bd":{"type":"apps","blocks":{"c461cbc9-6a68-4061-b855-7055481e2bcd":{"type":"shopify:\/\/apps\/judge-me-reviews\/blocks\/review_widget\/61ccd3b1-a9f2-4160-9fe9-4fec8413e5d8","settings":{}}},"block_order":["c461cbc9-6a68-4061-b855-7055481e2bcd"],"settings":{"include_margins":true}},"260f0ae5-fa4f-494c-8cdd-2e8720b600b3":{"type":"multicolumn","blocks":{"template--15523360735325__260f0ae5-fa4f-494c-8cdd-2e8720b600b3-column-1":{"type":"column","settings":{"title":"Further Reading","text":"<p><\/p><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/wegovy\">Wegovy Comprehensive Guide<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/is-wegovy-the-same-as-semaglutide\">Is Wegovy the Same as Semaglutide?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/wegovy-vs-orlistat\">Wegovy vs Orlistat - What’s the difference?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/can-you-get-wegovy-on-the-nhs\">Can you get Wegovy on the NHS?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/how-long-does-it-take-to-see-results-with-wegovy-setting-realistic-expectations\">Wegovy Before and After Photos<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/wegovy-vs-saxenda\">Wegovy vs. Saxenda<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/when-will-wegovy-be-available-in-the-uk\">When will Wegovy be Available in the UK?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/wegovy-vs-ozempic-whats-the-difference\">Wegovy vs Ozempic: Whats the difference?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/where-to-buy-wegovy\">Where to buy WeGovy in the UK?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/welzo.com\/blogs\/weight-loss\/7-side-effects-of-wegovy\">7 Side Effects of Wegovy<\/a><\/li><\/ul>","link_label":"","link":""}}},"block_order":["template--15523360735325__260f0ae5-fa4f-494c-8cdd-2e8720b600b3-column-1"],"settings":{"title":"","image_width":"full","image_ratio":"adapt","column_alignment":"left","background_style":"primary","button_label":"","button_link":"","swipe_on_mobile":false,"color_scheme":"background-1","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}}},"order":["main","270be98f-9a48-4388-bca9-64097383108d","product-recommendations","1654193691dfa28cc9","719f3664-affc-4802-8b12-06c78f232487","165346922221a5012f","16534182831dc0cb7b","e2c3040e-9ced-4573-a7e2-8182b67919ce","3ea5224d-b84b-4cfc-8611-6821a87ef30d","7854fb28-ec24-4d66-a6ec-25aa30b4d109","8e6e702b-77f2-4f30-a753-1dd5bc780bef","e9b27588-1a0e-4687-8f0d-3d40db4de881","4cd178df-3ba2-43b6-a856-363756fb2448","95eaf0ba-e886-40a0-9c43-6ae6c9bf9681","7e56dd23-5ca7-4e5c-90e3-bf6578ddfa96","1699015773272801bd","260f0ae5-fa4f-494c-8cdd-2e8720b600b3"]}
