Depression is treatable, and most people with depression feel better with medication, therapy or both.<\/p><p>Major Depression<\/p><p>Major depression is also known as clinical depression or unipolar depression. It’s characterized by severe symptoms that interfere with your ability to work, sleep, study, eat and enjoy life. An episode of major depression may occur only once in your lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout your life.<\/p><p>Persistent Depressive Disorder<\/p><p>Persistent depressive disorder, also known as dysthymia, is a less severe form of depression. But it lasts longer – at least two years. With persistent depressive disorder, you may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but your symptoms must last for at least two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder.<\/p><p>Depression in Bipolar<br\/><br\/>Because bipolar depression is characterized by mood swings or changes, it differs from other types of depression. Extreme highs (mania) and lows (depression) are common in people with bipolar depression. Depression symptoms are present during the low, or depressed, phase. Manic depression used to be another name for bipolar disorder.<br\/><br\/>Winter Depression<br\/><br\/>A type of depression that occurs at the same time every year is known as seasonal depression, also referred to as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). It usually coincides with the seasonal transitions and starts and ends roughly at the same times every year. Wintertime, when there is less natural sunlight, is when seasonal depression is more prevalent.<br\/><br\/>Pregnancy Depression<br\/><br\/>One type of depression that can develop after having a baby is postpartum depression.  <\/p><p><\/p><p>Mental Depression<br\/><br\/>Severe depression coupled with psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, is known as psychotic depression. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features is another name for depression with psychosis.<br\/><br\/>Contextual Depression<br\/><br\/>A stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, a job loss, or even retirement, can trigger situational depression, also known as adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Situational depression typically lasts only a short while and disappears after the stressful event is over.<br\/><br\/>Adverse Depression<br\/><br\/>A subtype of major depressive disorder is atypical depression. Atypical depression has symptoms that are similar to other types of depression, but you may also experience the following:<br\/>- Enhanced appetite<br\/><br\/>Gaining weight<br\/><br\/>-Sleepiness<br\/><br\/>-Feeling heavy in your legs or arms<br\/><br\/>-Concentration and attention issues<br\/><br\/>-Mood that elevates in response to good things happening<br\/><br\/><br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--15389620011101__c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea-1673004153f6a3b721-0","template--15389620011101__c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea-1673004153f6a3b721-1"],"settings":{"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}}},"order":["main","e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7","5cbe206a-8974-430b-ab53-0d3a9890d088","c23c9903-1d44-4abb-905d-51478af2e3ea"]}
