It mimics the action of these hormones, which prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg (known as ovulating). It will also make it more difficult for both sperm and eggs to implant in the lining of the womb.<\/p><p>- The progesterone-only pill, also known as the POP or mini pill). This pill works similarly to a combined pill but contains no oestrogen.
