Ergosterol serves as a starting point for the synthesis of other sterols, including cholesterol, so its absence may impair membrane function. According to in vitro research, Loprox is fungicidal to dermatophyte organisms like Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes (which cause athlete's foot), Epidermophyton floccosum (which causes ringworm), and Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes (which cause seborrheic dermatitis).<br\/><br\/>In vitro tests show that loprox is effective against some bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
