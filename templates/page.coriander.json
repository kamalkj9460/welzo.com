Although the entire plant can be eaten, the fresh leaves and dried seeds are the ones that are most frequently used in recipes. Southern Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern Asia are all places where coriander is indigenous. It is a soft plant that reaches a height of 50 cm (20 in). Variable in shape, the leaves are broadly lobed at the plant's base and slender and feathery higher up on the stems that bear the flowers. The flowers are borne in tiny umbels that are asymmetrical, white or very pale pink, and have longer petals pointing away from the umbel's center than those pointing toward it (which are only 1-3 mm or 006-012 in long). The fruit is a dry, globular schizocarp with a diameter of 3-5 mm (0.12-0.20 in)."}},"3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Overview","button_link":""}},"c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Uses","button_link":""}},"e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Side Effects","button_link":""}},"02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Medication","button_link":""}},"6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Ingredients","button_link":""}},"7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Supplements","button_link":""}},"9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Pharmacokinetics","button_link":""}},"template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Coriander.jpg"}}},"block_order":["template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-0","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-1","3697b572-00b3-4873-aadb-01e85df03254","c39256d7-f8c0-462f-9109-cc5c53138458","e1738aef-38ac-4846-bb48-4dbbbbed5d87","02803003-6821-40cf-95ac-12d635aeedde","6dd2932b-340e-4452-9c4a-96e1a9b89318","7cfda700-4c13-4a17-9f5a-f70032e2217f","9507a9fe-9b42-4083-bc48-a0a94b4ace7a","template--15291250016349__e2b7edc1-d652-4618-b007-0003c3d77ed7-16651460428fa33091-3"],"settings":{"body_text":"#12022f","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":150}},"d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c":{"type":"simple_text","blocks":{"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"What are the benefits of coriander?"}},"template--15291250016349__d767a08c-c125-438f-9f72-7cd51abe473c-1665156877c07d7099-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>There are several possible health advantages of coriander, including:<br\/><br\/>* Functioning as a painkiller<br\/><br\/>* Assisting in cholesterol reduction<br\/><br\/>* Controlling blood glucose levels<br\/><br\/>* Promoting intestinal health<br\/><br\/>* Assisting with detox<br\/><br\/>* Increasing immune function<br\/><br\/>* Reducing worry and easing tension<br\/><br\/>While more studies are required to confirm these potential health advantages, coriander consumption as part of a balanced diet is generally regarded as safe.<br\/><br\/>From soups and stews to curries and salads, a variety of dishes can benefit from the addition of coriander.
